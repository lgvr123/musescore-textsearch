## Download and Install ##
Download the [last stable version](https://github.com/lgvr123/musescore-textsearch/releases).
For installation see [Plugins](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/4/plugins).

## Support of MU4
**SUPPORTED**
The *Text Search* plugin works without known issues in MU3.6-3.7, and MU4.4+

## Know limitations
- Searching in lines' texts is possible but slow. This search is deactivated by default, and is activable by a specific option.<br/>
Searching in a big score can take up to 15". So be patient if you activate that option.

- Searching in text frames is **not possible** (limitation of the Musescore plugin API)
